# iAdviser

**The Web App is currently live on Google Cloud: [iAdvisor](http://35.231.25.86/).**

## Problem:
The Information Science(InfoSci) Department at the University of Maryland College Park started it's undergraduate program in fall 2016. Since it's started, the program has experienced tremendous growth to almost 800 individuals. As a result of the surge in interest, the InfoSci department has been forced to work hard to accommodate the increase in students. One major issue is advising within the department. There are only a handful of advisors to see all of these students and they simply cannot provide the necessary attention for each student.

## Solution:
iAdvisor was started in my web design class as a class projects. It has and continues to evolve into a functioning web app and the hope is it will help resolve the problems the InfoSci department faces by streamlining the four year planning process and allowing students to quickly and efficiently build thier schedule and allow advisors to view many students at a glance and provide feedback. The goal is for advisors to be able to accommodate many students at once and for students to have the freedom of four year planning at thier convenience.

# Features

- Users Can Edit and Save the InfoSci programs four year plan. The app will highlight classes that cannot be taken
together due to prerequisite requirements.
- Users Can click on any class to view details such as general information and available sections.
- Users can submit classes to advisors. *note: at the moment it currently downloads a CSV. CSV is the format the
advisors currently use for thier own database. The plan is for this feature to change.*

# Future Features

- Allow students to create thier class schedule in the app via a calendar
- Students will be able to map out thier route to class

# Technologies Used
- MySQL Workbech for DB management
- [UMD.io](https://umd.io/) For Class Info
